Here my git hooks I usually use in my projects

Installation: move on to githooks directory, and execute following command:
./install.sh PROJECT_DIR
where is PROJECT_DIR is a root directory of your project
The hooks are being symlinked to the folder hooks from this repository

Make sure that flake8 is installed in your virtual environment:
For now hooks validate python files, css, js files
